# FCC Markdown Previewer Project

## FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Certification

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The app is a simple markdown editor that allows you to type in markdown and see it rendered in the previewer.
